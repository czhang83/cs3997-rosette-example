This sample Rosette program follows this [tutorial](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/post/building-synthesizer.html).

The program defines a simple arithmetic DSL consisting of addition, multiplication, square, and maximum, represented by Racket's structures. The interpreter for this DSL is a recursive pattern matching.

The example shows how the program works on constant values, symbolic variables, and expressions generation.
